# Challenge

The initial website filtered UFO sightings by date. This updated website has five additional filters (Date, City, State, Country, Shape). This functionality allows users to have various ways  to filter the data and have more in depth analysis in regards to UFO sightings.

I would also consider th duration of the sighting as that can also have a factor on the sightings in a specific region happening for a longer period of time?
